# Support
You can contact the developer directly via this <a href="mailto:swarn@demonkingswarn.live">email</a>. However, the most recommended way is to head to the discord server.

<a href="https://discord.gg/JF85vTkDyC"><img src="https://invidget.switchblade.xyz/JF85vTkDyC"></a>

If you run into issues or want to request a new feature, you are encouraged to make a GitHub issue, won't bite you, trust me.


# Providers

Luffy uses 2 main providers, which you can easily change between by specifying them in the config file: `$HOME/.config/luffy/conf`

- flixhq:
    ```conf
    provider = "flixhq"
    ```
- brocoflix:
    ```conf
    provider = "brocoflix"
    ```
    **NOTE**: `brocoflix` doesn't return any subtitle urls, but the brocoflix quality is much better.

There are three experimental providers, using these may not always work. These are:

- sflix:
    ```conf
    provider = "sflix"
    ```

- braflix:
    ```conf
    provider = "braflix"
    ```

- hdrezka:
    ```conf
    provider = "hdrezka"
    ```

Also note that `flixhq` is the default provider.
